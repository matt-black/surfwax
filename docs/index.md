# surfwax

A JAX implementation of 2D and 3D SURF, for finding scale-invariant keypoints in images and volumes.

## Introduction

SURF is "Speeded Up Robust Features", originally described in [1], is an algorithm for finding and characterizing scale- and rotation-invariant keypoints in images.
A good overview of the algorithm can be found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features).

For volumes, a SURF-like algorithm described in [2] is used.
